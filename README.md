## Overview

SonarMeta has always been interested in intellectual property (IP). In the current Web2 platform economy, many potentially valuable IPs fail to thrive due to the monopoly and precise control of traffic. Creators often do not receive fair compensation, and copyright infringement is becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, SonarMeta aims to create a network where IP works as nodes and authorization acts as edges in a value network. The value of IP can be accurately captured, and it can circulate on the blockchain.

The key to increasing the value of IP is the growth of its traffic. The simplest way to drive traffic is to authorize others to create derivatives. Authorization is the tool to gain traffic. When IP becomes more valuable, its authorization becomes more expensive. The price of authorization and its circulation reflect the value of IP. Thus, SonarMeta mints authorizations as NFTs, ensuring that the value of IP is not only captured but also circulates with its transactions. When authorizations circulate on the market, it means new derivatives and new traffic are generated, increasing the value of IP and its authorizations. This, in turn, enhances the overall network's value.

Any creative organization, DAO, or individual creator can be seen as an IP. SonarMeta will transform the relationship between these entities from purely social to interest-based. More valuable IPs can purchase the authorizations of less valuable IPs at a lower cost and drive traffic to them. When the value of the latter increases, the value of the authorizations held by the former also increases. They can then sell these authorizations at a higher price to other IPs looking to drive traffic from the latter. This incentivizes the entire creator ecosystem to assist IPs that couldn't access early resources due to the exploitation of the Web2 platform economy, unlocking endless possibilities.

Each IP has its internal contributors. SonarMeta uses Token Bound Accounts (TBAs) mentioned in ERC-6551 to track the contributors to each work. Different parts contributed by various contributors, such as different layers of a painting or segments of a music piece, are minted as component NFTs and placed in the work's TBA. This TBA serves as the receiving account for authorization NFTs. When a work is traded, authorized, or generates profit from commercial activities, the TBA acts as the receiving account and accurately indexes its components to calculate the dividends owed to each contributor. This motivates any creator to work harder and earn more.

In the end, this network ensures that the value of IP can be captured and circulated. Traffic distribution is determined by the entire creator ecosystem rather than being controlled by Web2 content platforms. Copyright is protected, IPs form interest-based relationships, and everyone becomes a shareholder of the IPs they contribute to, enjoying their deserved profits.
